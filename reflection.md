What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I feel like I walked into this assignment without all the information needed to succeed. For example, I didn't know that different classes could reference each other. Only when I knew that could I work on the buy and sell methods in oo_resale_shop. I also had no idea how to set up the inventory and itemID variables. I thought they would have to be named as attributes directly under class ResaleShop and be made as constructors like this: def __init__(self, inventory, itemID): which totally wouldn't have worked but we've only ever worked on setting up contructors like that in class. 

If I was going to give someone advice in the future I'd tell them all the things I listed above and I would tell them that we do not have to worry about what actual values are given in place of the variables. The point of the methods is that they will work on the variables no matter their actual definition. It's like how you don't have to know whats in a box to wrap it. The point is that the stuff in the box gets wrapped, you don't have to know if the gift is blue or yellow etc.
